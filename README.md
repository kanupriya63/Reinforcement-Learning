# Reinforcement-Learning
In **part one**, several bandit algorithms have been solved. Following this, we discuss their empirical performance which is concluded by discussing and understanding the behaviour of different algorithms.
In **part 2**, several reinforcement learning algorithms have been implemented on few problems to understand their properties.
In **part 3**, we implement a complete deep reinforcement learning agent.
In **part 4**, we execute a number of off-policy multi-step return estimates and discuss their accuracy.
